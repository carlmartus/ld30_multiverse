	Story:<br/>
	An interdimensional lord of the creep have decided to expand his realm beyond
	his own plane of existance. This is bad news for you because creeps eat people
	and destroy the precious environment. Now it's up to you, an interdimensional
	crusader guarding the wellbeing of a few dimensions that has been assigned to
	you. All eight of them must be cleansed.
	</p>

	<p>
	A number on your HUD will show which dimension you're in and your health can
	be seen next to the game view. You must pass through each level destroying
	the creeps with your machine gun. If you die you may try again :)
	</p>

	<p>
	TL;DR<br/>
	You're cleansing different dimensions from fierce creeps!
	</p>

	Protip:<br/>
	When the eyes of the creeps are glowing, they take 4X damage.<br/>
	Don't let yourself get surrounded by them!
